# 1. Business Problems

**House Rocket** is a fictiticious company whose business model is the purchase and sale of real estate.

**Purpose:** find the best business opportunities in the real estate market and maximize the company's revenue using machine learning modeling. 

**Strategy:** buy properties in good condition at low prices and then resell them at higher prices. 

The dataset used in this projetc contains house sales price for King County (USA) in the period between May 2014 and May 2015. It is available on [Kaggle - House Sales in King County](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). 

House Rocket's CEO asked for a machine learning model to make better decisions in their real estate business model. To help to take decisions, he set the following **business problems**:

- 1. What properties should we purchase and at what price?
- 2. After the properties are in the company's possession, what is the best time to sell them and what would the sale prices be?
- 3. Should House Rocket do a renovation to raise the sale price? What would be the suggestions for changes? What is the price increase given for each refurbishment option?

# 2. Business Assumptions (Formulated Hypothesis)

**Assumptions (hypothesis)** were formulated in order to be tested.

1. Properties **located in Seattle** are **5% more expensive**, on median;
2. Properties with **basement** are **20% more expensive**, on median;
3. Properties which were **renovated after 2000's** are **40% more expensive**, on median;
4. Properties **constructed after 2000's** are **2% cheaper**, on median;
5. The **property prices** are **related to the day of the week, to the month, to the season and to the year**. 

# 3. Solution Strategy

**Step 01 - Exploratory data analysis:** the main goal is better understand the dataset by applying statistics metrics as well as identifying missing values and outliers.

**Step 02 - Feature selection:** identifying the most important attributes related to the price.

**Step 03 - Assumptions test (Hypothesis test) and business problems solutions:** testing the formulated hypothesis and solving the business problems set by the CEO.

**Step 04 - Feature Engineering:** Developing new attributes based on the original features in order to better describe the phenomenon to be modeled. 

**Step 05 - Machine Learning Model:** Training and selecting the Machine Learning model to choose the best parameter values. 

**Step 06 - Insights:** the highlight of the main insights.

**Step 07 - Conversion of insights:** converting insights into business results.
